## Operators

All types support the following operators:
- Equal `==`
- Not Equal `!=`

The `Bit` type supports the following logical operators.
- And `&`
- Or `|`
- Exclusive or `^`
- Not `~`

The `Array` type supports the following operator.
- Dynamic bit selection `bits_obj[add.O]` (select a bit dynamically using a magma value)

The `Bits` type supports the following logical operators.
- And `&`
- Or `|`
- Exclusive or `^`
- Not `~`
- Logical right shift (with zeros) `>>`
- Logical left shift (with zeros) `<<`

The `UInt` and `SInt` types support all the logical operators
as well as arithmetic and comparison operastors.
- Add `+`
- Subtract/Negate `-`
- ~~Multiply `*`~~ Unsupported because mantle lacks an implementation, pull request welcome!
- ~~Divide `/`~~ Unsupported because mantle lacks an implementation, pull request welcome!
- Less than `<`
- Less than or equal `<=`
- Greater than `>`
- Greater than or equal `>=`

Note that the the right shift operator when applied to an `SInt` becomes
an arithmetic shift right operator (which replicates the sign bit as it shifts right).

### Verilog Users Guide

Here we provide a mapping between Verilog's standard operators, as defined by
[IEEE Std 1800-2017: IEEE Standard for SystemVerilogâ€”Unified Hardware Design,
Specification, and Verification
Language](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8299595) (page 256, Table 11-1
-- Operators and data types).

#### Assignment
| Verilog Operator | Magma Operator | Types | Context | Comments |
|------------------|----------------| ----- | ------- | -------- |
| `=`              | `m.wire`, **TODO (=)**  | Any   | All     | Assignment cannot be overloaded for arbitrary Python variables, so in general we must use `m.wire`. There are plans to add support for assignment to attributes of magma types, such as `reg.I = io.I`. |
| `+=`, `-=`, `/=`, `*=` | `None`   | None  | All     | Again, unsupported due to the lack of support for overloading assignment. May be added in the future for attributes of magma types |
| `%=` | `None` | None | All | See above |
| `&=`, `|=`, `^=` | `None` | None | All | See above |
| `>>=`, `<<=` | `None` | None | All | See above |
| `>>>=`, `<<<=` | `None` | None | All | See above |

#### Conditional Operator
| Verilog Operator | Magma Operator | Types | Context | Comments |
|------------------|----------------| ----- | ------- | -------- |
| `?:`              | `<true_exp> if <cond> else <false_exp>`       | `true_exp : T`, `cond_exp : Bit`,  `false_exp : T`    | `m.circuit.combinational`     | Currently only supported inside the `m.circuit.combinational` syntax because it requires inspection of the AST and rewriting it into a `Mux`. The true expression and the false expression should have the same type, the condition expression should have a Bit type. |

#### Unary Logical Operators
| Verilog Operator | Magma Operator | Types | Context | Comments |
|------------------|----------------| ----- | ------- | -------- |
| `!`                | **TODO**         | `m.Bit`, `m.Bits` |  All | Logical operators like `not` cannot be overloaded in Python. Planned support for a mantle function `m.lnot` as an alternative |
| `~`, `&`, `~&`, `|`, `~|`, `^`, `~^`, `^~` | **TODO** | `m.Bits` | All | Python does not have built-in support for reduction operators. Use the python `reduce` function instead, e.g. `reduce(mantle.nand, value)`. |

#### Unary Arithmetic Operators
| Verilog Operator | Magma Operator | Types | Context | Comments |
|------------------|----------------| ----- | ------- | -------- |
| `+`, `-` |  **TODO** | `m.SInt` | All | Can override `__neg__` and `__pos__` to implement these |
| `++`, `--` | None | None | All | No planned support since not available in Python, use `+= 1` and `-= 1` instead. |

#### Binary Logical Operators
| Verilog Operator | Magma Operator | Types | Context | Comments |
|------------------|----------------| ----- | ------- | -------- |
| `<<`, `>>`       | `<<`, `>>`     | `m.Bits` | All | **TODO: What does verilog expect for bit width of the shift value? What does magma expect?** |
| `&&`, `||`       | **TODO**       | `m.Bits` | All | Python doesn't support overloading logical and and or, we can provide mantle functions instead |
| `->`, `<->`      | None       | None | All | **TODO: What are these operators?** |
| `==`, `!=`       | `==`, `!=`     | All | All |  |

#### Binary Arithmetic Operators
| Verilog Operator | Magma Operator | Types | Context | Comments |
|------------------|----------------| ----- | ------- | -------- |
| `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` | `UInt`, `SInt` | All | **TODO: Define numeric or integral type where UInt and SInt are sub types** |
| `%` | `UInt`, `SInt` | All | **TODO: Define numeric or integral type where UInt and SInt are sub types** |
| `>>>`, `<<<`     | `>>`, `<<` | `SInt` | All | Python does not provide a separate operator for arithmetic shift operators. Instead, we overload the meaning of the normal shift operators on `SInt` types. To use the logical variant, one can use the operator function directly `mantle.lsr` or convert the type to `Bits` or `UInt`. **TODO: Double check that these are properly defined for SInt**. Note, according to the SV spec, arithmetic left shift is the same as logical left shift. |

#### Concatenation and Replication Operators
| Verilog Operator | Magma Operator | Types | Context | Comments |
|------------------|----------------| ----- | ------- | -------- |
| `{}`     | `m.concat`     | All   | All     | |
| `{{}}`     | **TODO**     | All   | All     | **TODO: We could use something similar to Python's list replication syntax: `[4] * 4` |

#### Others
| Verilog Operator | Magma Operator | Types | Context | Comments |
|------------------|----------------| ----- | ------- | -------- |
| `===`, `!==`     | None | None | None | Magma currently does not support 4-state logic (`===` tests for 1, 0, z, and x) |
| `==?`, `!=?`     | None | None | None | See above (`==?` treat X and Z values in a given bit position as a wildcard (matches any value)) |
| `inside`         | None | None | None | **TODO: Could use Python's `in` syntax to implement this, but is this typically used in synthesized code?** |
| `dist`           | None | None | None | Verification feature used for constraints |
| `{<<{}}`, `{>>{}}` | None | None | None |  |
